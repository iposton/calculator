calculator
==========
  This is a working calculator that will add, subtract, multiply and divide any two numbers. Simply enter a value followed by an operator (-, +, *, /) then another value then click equal button for the total sum. This calculator was made with html, css, and javascript. I made this in week 2 at WDI in Santa Monica.
